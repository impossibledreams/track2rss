-------------------------------------------------
II. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION.
-------------------------------------------------

1. Create a directory on your webserver where you are going to install
this program. For some systems, this must be within the CGI-BIN directory
in order for the script to execute.

2. Extract all of the files provided into that directory.

3. If you are running on a UNIX or Linux system, execute the following command
to set proper permissions:

chmod 755 track2rss.pl

4. Open the "track2rss.pl" file with an editor of your choice. In the beginning
of the file find a section titled "User Configuration Information". Fill in
the XML access key, username and password provided to you by UPS and save the
file. You should also fill in the data provided by USPS. OPTIONAL - You can
fill a URL pointing to a CSS stylesheet used to format the RSS feed.

5. Execute the following commands in command shell to verify installation:

perl track2rss.pl <testups.txt
perl track2rss.pl <testusps.txt
perl track2rss.pl <testfedex_air.txt
perl track2rss.pl <testfedex_ground.txt

You should get XML output in your shell.

6. In order to use USPS's systems, you must contact them and ask for your username
to be switched to production servers. Call the USPS Internet Customer Care Center
at 1-800-210-9512. Once you are switched to the production servers, comment out
the testing URL from the script and substitute the production URL.

7. In order to use Fedex's systems, you must contact them and ask for your account
to be switched to production servers. Call the Fedex Customer Care Center
at 1-800-810-9073. Once you are switched to the production servers, use the eclosed
"fedex.html" file to obtain a meter number, comment out the testing URL from the
script and substitute the production URL.

8. Try to execute the script from your webserver by running the following command
(substitute the code in brackets for your server and directory):

[http://www.example.com/dir/]track2rss.pl?type=ups&tracking_number=1Z12345E1512345676
[http://www.example.com/dir/]track2rss.pl?type=usps&tracking_number=01038555749406853207
[http://www.example.com/dir/]track2rss.pl?type=fedex_air&tracking_number=844613667324
[http://www.example.com/dir/]track2rss.pl?type=fedex_ground&tracking_number=123456789123

You should see XML output in your web browser. This tracking number is provided
by UPS for testing purpose: 1Z12345E1512345676. Tracking number provided for USPS
is 01038555749406853207. Tracking numbers for Fedex are 123456789123 for Ground and
844613667324 for Air.

NOTE: Starting with version 0.4.1, the type parameter may be omitted and the script
will try to auto-guess the carrier. However, this will not work with Fedex Ground.

-------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------

All data generated by this project includes support for A9's OpenSearch v1.0
format. HOWEVER, in order to use this functionality you MUST to to the
